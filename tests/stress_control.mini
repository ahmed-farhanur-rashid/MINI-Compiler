--- CONTROL FLOW STRESS TEST ---

--- Test 1: Basic when/otherwise conditions ---
number x = 5;
number y = 10;

when (x < y) {
    display("x is less than y");
}

when (x > y) {
    display("x is greater than y");
} otherwise {
    display("x is not greater than y");
}

--- Test 3: Repeat loops with numbers ---
repeat (3) {
    display("Loop iteration");
}

repeat (x) {
    display("Variable repeat");
}

--- Test 4: Simple conditions ---
when (x + y > 10) {
