--- Test complex string concatenation with toString() ---
number pi;
number scientific;
string greeting;

pi = 3.14159;
scientific = 6.022e23;
greeting = "Hello";

--- Simple concatenation (should work) ---
string simple;
simple = "Pi is " + toString(pi);

--- Complex concatenation (currently broken) ---
string complex;
complex = "Pi is " + toString(pi) + " and Avogadro is " + toString(scientific);

--- Even more complex ---
string veryComplex;
veryComplex = greeting + " world! " + toString(pi) + " is pi and " + toString(scientific) + " is Avogadro's number.";

display(simple + "\n");
display(complex + "\n");
display(veryComplex + "\n");
