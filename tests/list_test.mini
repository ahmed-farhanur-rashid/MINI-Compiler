--- Test list functionality with C++ vector-like behavior ---
list<number> numbers(5);
list<string> words(3);

--- Test push_back ---
numbers.push_back(10.5);
numbers.push_back(20.7);
numbers.push_back(30.9);

words.push_back("hello");
words.push_back("world");

--- Test size ---
display(numbers.size());
display(words.size());

--- Test access ---
display(numbers[0]);
display(numbers[1]);
display(words[0]);
display(words[1]);

--- Test pop_back ---
numbers.pop_back();
display(numbers.size());
