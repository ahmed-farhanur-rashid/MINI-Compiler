--- Comprehensive List Test with C++ Vector Functions ---

--- Test list<number> declarations and basic operations ---
list<number> nums(2);
display(nums.size());

--- Test push_back operations ---
nums.push_back(100.5);
nums.push_back(200.7);
nums.push_back(300.9);
nums.push_back(400.1);

--- Test size after push_back ---
display(nums.size());

--- Test array-style access ---
display(nums[0]);
display(nums[1]);
display(nums[2]);
display(nums[3]);

--- Test pop_back operations ---
nums.pop_back();
display(nums.size());
nums.pop_back();
display(nums.size());

--- Test list<string> with dynamic resizing ---
list<string> words(1);
words.push_back("first");
words.push_back("second");
words.push_back("third");
words.push_back("fourth");
words.push_back("fifth");

--- Test string list access ---
display(words.size());
display(words[0]);
display(words[1]);
display(words[2]);
display(words[3]);
display(words[4]);

--- Test mixed operations ---
words.pop_back();
words.pop_back();
display(words.size());
